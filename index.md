## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3

I enjoyed lab 3 because it now started to feel as if we were finally getting into the materials that we had been learning. It was the basics of leaning c++ but it did have some small challenges. I liked how these challenges were not too difficult and at some point I was able to figure it out which would feel rewarding.

Lab 4

Lab 4 was a bit more challenging, but I think it was made secure as one of my favorites was because my partner and I were able to communicate very well when it came to figuring out how to code the TO DOs. Although we were not able to code it as easily as lab 3, we were still able to get around the ballpark and would need to switch minor errors. When we realized the small mistake, we were not discouraged but just happy we were almost able to get the answer.

Lab 11

This lab was very challenging at first but because I had learned so much throughout the semester my partner and I were able to figure it out. We even finished before the lab ended, and it was the first time I had done that this whole semester, so I felt accomplished.
